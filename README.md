# PyBer_Analysis

In this project, we create a dataframe of ride sharing data by three city types (rural,suburban, urban) showing the total weekily fares for each city type. 


# Overview 

PyBer is a transportation serivce provider that develops, markets, and operates an applicaiton on smartphones. The CEO is curious about how the ride sharing fared for each of the three city types: rural, suburban, and urban cities. We have conducted our findings using Pandas. In particular, to make the charts, we have used a Python plotting library called MatPlotLib. From this library, we can create various charts to our perference, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. In this scenario, we want to observe how the ride fares are affected for each city type every week between January through April of 2019. 

# Results 

There are three different ways to decribe the area where people live in the context of population amount. The three types of cities are Rural, Urban, and Suburban cities. The objective is to examine the differences in the ride sharing data amoung rides conducted in rural, urban, and suburban cities. The data provided by PyBer includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and the toal fare by city type. Throughout the project, we have computed and compliled the data in Jupyter Notebook. The code wrriten to produce the outputs is in the file "PyBer_Challenge.ipynb". 

The first piece of data to observe is the total amount of rides for each city type. Here is the total amount of rides for each city type shown below.

As we can see from the output, urban cities produced the most number of rides while in rural areas, they produced the lease number of rides. 

The second piece of data to observe is the total number of drivers. Here is the total amount of drivers for each city type shown below.

From the piece of data, we observe Urban cities produced the most number of drivers while rural areas produced the least amount of cities. 


The third piece of data to observe is the total fare for each city type. Here is the total fare for each city type shown below.

In this observation, urban cities produced the most amount of money for the fares while Rural cities producted the least amount of money in fares. 

The fourth piece of data to observe is the average fare per ride. Here is the average fare per ride for each city type shown below.

From this piece of data, Rural cities produced the highest average fare amount for each ride while Urban cities produced the least average fare amount for each ride. 

The fifth piece of data to observe is the average fare per driver. Here is the average fare per driver for each city type shown below.

We find out that Rural cities produced the highest average fare amount for each driver while Urban cities produced the least average fare for each driver. 

Finally, the piece of information to examine is how the total fare is affected for each city type. We have conducted this research by creating a line chart displaying the total fares for each week through the span of January through April of 2019. This chart is shown below.

# Summary

There are a few things to point out before giving out reccomendations to improve the business and customer satisfaction of PyBer. 

Gnerally, the difference between the three types of cities is the area. Typically, Rural areas are open and spread out with a small population. However, suburban and urban cities are more confined that has a higher population. Suburban cities are residental areas with a medium sized population while Urban cities are working areas that produce the maximum popualtion amount. Rural areas are countrysides where farming natural resurces occur. In suburban cities, there are numerous housing areas available larger cities. Urban areas usually have the higher population as the other two city types. Also, urban cities are congested. 

Here are some reccomendations for the CEO to imporve the Pyber ride sharing buisness. People who live in Rural area have a large amount of land that is spread out. Therefore, people are not likely to find office buildings, major grocery store chains, or even shopping malls. Often, these areas have some locally owned businesses such as banks or gasoline stations. This could be the reason Rural cities produced the least total fare. One suggestion is to keep an eye of the target demographic. Cater the ride sharing app to people that live in suburban or urban cities. That way, this will increase profit and will drop the cost dramatically.
