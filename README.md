# PyBer_Analysis

In this project, we create a dataframe of ride sharing data by three city types (rural,suburban, urban) showing the total weekily fares for each city type. 


# Overview 

PyBer is a transportation serivce provider that develops, markets, and operates an applicaiton on smartphones. The CEO is curious about how the ride sharing fared for each of the three city types: rural, suburban, and urban cities. We have conducted our findings using Pandas. In particular, to make the charts, we have used a Python plotting library called MatPlotLib. From this library, we can create various charts to our perference, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. In this scenario, we want to observe how the ride fares are affected for each city type every week between January through April of 2019.
