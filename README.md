# PyBer_Analysis

In this project, we create a dataframe of ride sharing data by three city types (rural,suburban, urban) showing the total weekily fares for each city type. 


# Overview 

PyBer is a transportation serivce provider that develops, markets, and operates an applicaiton on smartphones. The CEO is curious about how the ride sharing fared for each of the three city types: rural, suburban, and urban cities. We have conducted our findings using Pandas. In particular, to make the charts, we have used a Python plotting library called MatPlotLib. From this library, we can create various charts to our perference, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. In this scenario, we want to observe how the ride fares are affected for each city type every week between January through April of 2019. 

# Results 

Our objective is to examine the differences in the ride sharing data amoung rides conducted in rural, urban, and suburban cities. The data provided by PyBer includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and the toal fare by city type. Throughout the project, we have computed and compliled the data in Jupyter Notebook. The code wrriten to produce the outputs is in the file "PyBer_Challenge.ipynb". 

The first piece of data to observe is the total amount of rides for each city type. Here is the total amount of rides for each city type shown below.

As we can see from the output, urban cities produced the most number of rides while in rural areas, they produced the lease number of rides. 

The second piece of data to observe is the total number of drivers. Here is the total amount of drivers for each city type shown below.
